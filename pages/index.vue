      <p class="text-lg py-2">
        I‚Äôm a passionate Flutter Developer with over a year of hands-on experience in building high-performance cross-platform applications. I‚Äôve led multiple projects from scratch and enhanced existing applications with impactful features, consistently delivering clean, scalable, and maintainable code. My expertise spans mobile, web, and desktop platforms, and I‚Äôm particularly skilled in GetX, Bloc, Riverpod & Provider state management, MVC & MVVM architecture, and integrating complex features such as barcode scanning, video/audio calling, chat systems, payment gateways, and multilingual support.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg py-2">
       Currently, I serve as a SDE2 at HackerKernel, guiding junior developers and conducting code reviews across teams. My leadership and technical contributions recently earned me a 10/10 in my performance review. I‚Äôve published a Flutter package called universal_file_viewer and I‚Äôm actively maintaining it to support more formats like Excel, CSV, PPT, and web files.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg py-2">
       I‚Äôve worked on diverse domains such as healthcare, e-commerce (Shopify integrations), pharmacy systems, Fintech Apps, and productivity tools like Rise Pathway. I‚Äôm also exploring web development with focus on NUXT JS and backend development with a focus on Java (Spring Boot) and Golang to become a more well-rounded full-stack developer.
